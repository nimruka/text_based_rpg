# Introduction
This is my cloud project assignment 2 for Murdoch University ICT171 Introduction to Server Environments and Architectures module.


This a text-based RPG game built using HTML, CSS and Python and hosted on AWS cloud.

## Features
- Text input/output interactions
- Backend logic built using Python(Flask).
- Frontend developed using HTML and CSS
- Hosted on AWS

# Development Process

The devellopment of the project can be divided into seperate sub steps.
- Creating and setting up a Instance on AWS
- Setting up public IP for the instance using Elastic IP
- Setting up inbound and outbound neytwork traffic through VPC and Security Groups
- Buying a domain name through AWS Route 53
- Accessing the Instance via the domain name using Route53 Hosted Zones
- Setting up SSL using certbot
- Developing the Text base game using HTML, CSS and Python (Flask).
- Testing the code and finalizing

# Additional Feature

## Bash Utility: RPG Stat Manager
To demonstrate CLI scripting knowledge, I created a Bash tool (rpg_stats.sh) that allows saving and loading character stats to a file. This simulates external developer tools that might support a text-based RPG engine like Twine.

The script allows input of:

Player Name

Health

Strength

Intelligence

Dexterity

This showcases integration of shell scripting with storytelling/game logic.
